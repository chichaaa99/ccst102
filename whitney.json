Users get a weekly allocation—typically 30 hours of GPU time and 20 hours of TPU time—for building, training, and experimenting within a ready-to-use environment. Its scoring and medal systems place users on public leaderboards, fostering learning, visibility, and career opportunities through recognition and performance."

In the 2011 IJCNN Traffic Sign Recognition contest, their model made just 0.56% mistakes, which is about half the error rate of people, who made 1.16% mistakes on average. This was not only better than humans but also clearly ahead of other computer methods."

They compete with each other, helping the system get better over time."
